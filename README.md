## Lab 2

The purpose of this lab was to create a program that will read in the number
of nodes in the graph and the corresponding adjacency matrix, and echo the 
adjacency matrix to my output file. In order to run the program (2) runtime 
arguments must be entered into the command line: the name of the data.txt file
, and the name of the output.txt file you want to write to. Without those two
runtime arguments the program will not execute properly. The out.txt file will
be empty until the program writes its output to the file.

I provided a series of test case files entitled: testInput1.txt, testInput2.txt, 
testInput3.txt, and testInput4.txt. These files were made to make sure that 
the program ran properly. I accounted for various use cases varying in 
extreme levels, and random controls I wanted to test for.

### Usage

```bash
java Lab1 input.txt output.txt
```
